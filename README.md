STEPS REQUIRED TO RUN THE APPLICATION:

1. Download all the files and directories located at https://github.com/Valcarcel/Frogger to your local harddrive. Specifically, download the index.html, and the css, images, js directories inculing all the files contained within these directories.

2. Open index.html using the Chrome web browser, or the Firefox web browser.

INSTRUCTIONS TO PLAY THE GAME:

Once index.html is loaded into a compatible web browser, you will see the Player in the center of the lower green portion of the screen, and you will see the beetles (AKA, the enemies) moving across the screen from left to right. You can move the Player using the up, down, left and right arrow keys of the keyboard. 

The object of the game is to move the player from the green grass at the bottom of the canvas to the blue water at the top of the canvas while avoiding collisions with the enemy beetles.
